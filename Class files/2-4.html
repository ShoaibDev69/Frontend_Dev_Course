    <h1>What is Blockchain ?</h1> 
	
	<p>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a
    computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in
    cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of
    transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains
    can be used to make data in any industry immutableâ€”the term used to describe
    the inability to be altered.</p> 
	
	Because there is no way to change a block, the
    only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This
    aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually
    auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes. Since Bitcoin's
    introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of
    various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications,
    non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.
