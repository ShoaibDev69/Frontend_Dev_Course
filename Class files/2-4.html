    <h1>What is Blockchain ?</h1>

    <p>
      A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger

      nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency
      systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions,
      but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used
      to make data in any industry immutableâ€”the term used to describe the
      inability to be altered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the
      point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need
      for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that
      add costs and make mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via
      the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi)
      applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.
